            .../api/v1/sds?q=labels contains weather&labels contains
            cow&auth_required eq false ``` <br/><br/> A series of binary
            operators and operands.

            - The lefthand side operands are the field names.

            - The righthand side (RHS) operands are *constants* of the
            corresponding type.

            - The allowed operators are dependent on the operand types.

                - **geometric operands:** the RHS input should be [OGC well-known text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), limited to point,
            linestring, and polygon types. Geometric-types operands may use
            `intersects`, `contains`, and `within`.  <br/>

            We also allow the non-standard bounding box as a geometric RHS. This
            is of the form BBOX(lower_left_long lower_left_lat, upper_right_lon
            upper_right_lat).  <br/>

                - **String operands** may use `eq`, `contains`, and `not`.  <br/>

                - **Numeric operands** may use `eq`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`,
            `gte`, and `not`. <br/>

                - **Time operands** may use `eq`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`,
            `gte`, and `not`.  RHS must be supplied in [ISO 8601
            format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)<br/>

                - **String *array* operands** may only use `contains`. The RHS string will
                be checked for partial matches against all strings in the LHS array. The RHS
                string has a minimum length of three characters.
                
                - **Boolean operands** may only use `eq`.


            If multiple criteria are specified, they are considered as an *AND*
            operation.  Multiple criteria may be provided via multiple q
            parameters. <br/>
